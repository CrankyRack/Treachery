 POLITICS_SEOSAMH_MAC_TIRE_DESC:0 "§YBorn: 17th of June 1854§! \n\nSeosamh Mac Tíre is an example that some of the brightest and most talented come from the most unlikely backgrounds and places. Seosamh was born in Leinster to a veteran of the October rising, and was raised with Gaelic as his first language, and English as his second. His father would tutor him to be a warrior of Ireland, and a warrior of Ireland he would become. Sent to Paris to be trained in the French army, Seosamh would join and serve under Napoleon’s illustrious Legion of Ireland, fighting across the world; from Africa, to Asia, to Europe. This education showed the world that Seosamh was a strategic genius. \n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest commanders of Irish history, Seosamh used this fame to ascend to the highest position in Ireland, the Taoiseach. During his tenure, he has continued to expand the Grand Army of Ireland, and stoked the roaring fires of Irish Militarism. Many have compared him to Napoleon I, rising from obscurity to the highest levels of society, and it is a title that Seosamh has embraced with pride. Ireland will be defended for as long as her Bonaparte remains at the helm."
